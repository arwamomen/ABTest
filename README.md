# ABTest

This project was created as part of Udacity's Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree Program (egFWD initiative).

In this project, the A/B test run results are provided by a hypothetical e-commerce company in the file 'ab_data.csv'. 
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. To help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or run the experiment longer to make their decision, hypotheses were formulated and tested using a variety of methods from inferential statistics, including the p-test, confidence intervals, Z-test, and finally, logistic regression. 

Logistic regression was repeated after introducing an additional explanatory variable: The country in which a user resides in, given in the file 'countries.csv'.
